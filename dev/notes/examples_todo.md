1) Add main importable heartbeat func and example of using that
- Settings (BaseSettings) - host, port, https - and service name

Bonus:
- example for telegram bot
More ideas
- example for something else? REST Api call (for n8n)
- example for asyncio
- example for non-asyncio 

Extra Bonus:

  - 1 - heartbeat interval
  - 2 - type: local, cloud, etc
  - 3 - is it a job or a service

First services to add:
