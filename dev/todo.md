# TODO List and Improvement Ideas

## Requested Improvements

a) Web Dashboard using FastUI
- Create a simple web dashboard to see the statuses of the apps
- Use FastUI for implementation

b) Enhanced Service Lifecycle
- Implement a basic lifetime flow for the service: alive -> silent -> down -> dead
- Implement logic for how this is used:
    * Soft notify when service is silent
    * Hard notify when service is down - include in daily summaries alert section
    * Stop including in daily summaries once service is dead (after a week of downtime)
- Notify when a service went silent

c) Debug Mode
- Create a 'debug' mode in which things are much faster
- Example: 'daily' summary is sent more frequently in debug mode

d) Testing and Verification
- Develop strategies for testing and checking that the application actually works
